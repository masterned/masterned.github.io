        <h1>Hello all!</h1>

	<p>Welcome to my site. As you can see, it is very much a work in
	progress, but it is coming along.</p>

	<div>I have a few goals for this site:</div>
	<ol>
	    <li>The whole site needs to be entirely HTML and CSS</li>
	    <li>I need a page to house my current resume(s)</li>
	    <li>I can only use vim (neovim) to write it</li>
	    <li>I need to be proud of how it looks</li>
	    <li>The source needs to be well organized</li>
	    <li>The git log needs to stay clean</li>
	    <li>Needs to use semantic elements</li>
	    <li>Add accessibility meta data</li>
	    <li>Must use a consistent layout for styling</li>
	</ol>

	<p>I'm using this site not only to promote myself, but also to improve
	my skills (my typing still needs some work, hehe). Hopefully, along the
	way, I learn something new too!</p>
